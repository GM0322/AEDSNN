#AEDSNN:An alternating edge-preserving diffusion and smoothing neural network for limited-angle computed tomography reconstruction
## Motivations 
The goal of this repository is to enable the reproduction of the experiments described in
 an alternating edge-preserving diffusion and smoothing neural network for limited-angle 
 computed tomography reconstruction.

## Requirements
* numpy,os
* PyTorch
* CUPY
* a fast Nvidia GPU or a large amount of patience for training
